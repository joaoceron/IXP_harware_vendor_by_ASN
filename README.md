# Mapping concentrations of device vendors at IXPs

Internet Exchange Points (IXPs) are among the most popular ways for Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and Content Distribution Networks (CDNs) to exchange traffic. In this post, we analyze the hardware that they use to connect to IXPs. We investigate  24 IXPs distributed across 15 countries, from the EU, US, Africa, and Brazil, which together interconnect more six thousand IXP members. Our goal is to determine if there is a market dominance from the part of the hardware vendors among IXP members.
